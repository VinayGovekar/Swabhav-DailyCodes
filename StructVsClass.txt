Class Code: (class provides the flexibility of combining data and methods (functions ) and it provides the re-usability called inheritance.)
public class Author {
  
    // Data members of class
    public string name;
    public string language;
    public int article_no;
    public int improv_no;
  
    // Method of class
    public void Details(string name, string language,
                        int article_no, int improv_no)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.language = language;
        this.article_no = article_no;
        this.improv_no = improv_no;
  
        Console.WriteLine("The name of the author is :  " + name
                          + "\nThe name of language is : " + language
                          + "\nTotal number of article published  " 
                          + article_no + "\nTotal number of Improvements:"
                          +" done by author is : " + improv_no);
    }
  
    // Main Method
    public static void Main(String[] args)
    {
  
        // Creating object
        Author obj = new Author();
  
        // Calling method of class
        // using class object
        obj.Details("Ankita", "C#", 80, 50);
    }
}

Structure Code:  (Struct should typically be used for grouping data)
public struct Car
{
  
    // Declaring different data types
    public string Brand;
    public string Model;
    public string Color;
}


A class has all members private by default. A struct is a class where members are public by default.
